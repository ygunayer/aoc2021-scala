# Advent of Code 2021
My solutions for Advent of Code 2021 in Scala.

## Running
You can either run a specific solution by running sbt with the solution number directly
```bash
$ sbt run 2
```

Or you can just let sbt run in CLI mode, and then run the solutions, which can be helpful when you want to run multiple solutions.

```bash
$ sbt

...

sbt> run 2
```
